#physics Engine

## Introduction
This project is a simple physics engine with the goal of maximum accessibility.

## Why it was created
The main reason for the creation of this project was my frustration with the Point2D class provided by JavaFx 8
It seems unnecessarily complicated to me, since Vectors aren't changeable once they are created.

## Goals
This library tries to improve on the problems with the standard JavaFx implementation by providing changeable vectors
and a basic physics engine to help getting started with the programming of physics simulations and animations.
All classes and methods are created with the goal of maximum accessibility and utility.

## How to contribute
If you want to contribute to this library by writing some code you can simply do that an open a pull request.
If you encounter a bug, need help or have a suggestion how to improve the code, you can do so by opening an issue.
If you don't know how to do that [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMykv2ZMyEQ) is an explanatory video about Github issues
and [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrSWLQsDL4) is one about pull requests.
